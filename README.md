# LP Format

A Visual Studio Code extension that provides syntax highlighting for `.lp` files.

The [LP format](https://docs.gurobi.com/projects/optimizer/en/current/reference/fileformats/modelformats.html#lp-format) is easier for humans to read than [MPS format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPS_(format)), and can often be more natural to produce.
